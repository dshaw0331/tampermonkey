Higher priority:
-solutions.extra_info.js
	-make revealed rules/extension UIDs clickable in hover/dialog
	-hook into users loaded event for extra info (doesnt show on profile switch from extensions tab)
	-trigger unsaved changes for extensions that have been modified by custom JS buttons
	-trigger extra_info on tab quick switch


Lower Priority:
-create git modules for JS libraries and shared utility methods (e.g., when, keepTrying)
